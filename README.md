# raman_spectrum_analysis
Python methods to fit raman spectra, interactively or automatically.

How to use the methods for spectrum fit: 

step 1: put all the spectra you want to analyze in the methods folder

step 2: run create_structure.py, this will create a folder for each spectrum

step 3a: run analyze.py label, where label is the name of the folder of the spectrum you which to analyze

step 3b: select the spectral region you want to use for the fit by clicking in the window that opens, than close the window

step 3c: select the data that is not background in the same way

step 3d: select the peaks of the spectrum by clicking, than the fit will start

step4: if you want to analyze several, similar spectra, run autoanalyze.py, you have to follow the steps 3a - 3d for the first spectrum, the others will be fitted automatically with the same model
